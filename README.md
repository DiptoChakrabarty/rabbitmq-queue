### Send and Receive Messages
![Producer&Consumer](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR_DeffYvm_NJFW0K1gzTjp-F1Fc60xgDThuA&usqp=CAU)
```sh
 - After Starting your rabbitmq server we are going to send messages and receive messages from the queue
 - Messages sent will be stored in the queue hence releasing the current program or process
 - Messages will be received by the receiver code and displayed 
 
 Run python3 send.py  to send messages to the queue
 - A new queue will be formed 
 - Message will be present in the queue
 Run python3 receive.py to receive messages from queue
 - It will retreive the message from the queue
 
 You can run receive.py before also , queue will be formed in both cases

```
![SenderMsg](https://github.com/DiptoChakrabarty/rabbitmq-queue/blob/main/images/msgstored.png)
* Sender sends their data and can continue on with its tasks further ahead

### Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
![RPC](https://www.rabbitmq.com/img/tutorials/python-six.png)
```sh
- In this we make use of two queues 
- Client creates an anonymous  callback queue
- Client provides required details in the queue
- Server picks up the required data from the client queue and does its processing (in this case tf idf of a document)
- The processed result is retured in another queue from where it is returned to client

Run python3 server.py

Run client.py 

```

![TwoQueues](https://github.com/DiptoChakrabarty/rabbitmq-queue/blob/main/images/rpc.png)

* Two Queues are generated , rpc is for server response and the random named one is generated by client
